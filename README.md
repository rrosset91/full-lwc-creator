# Full LWC Creator 💡

This extension is used to improve the core Salesforce CLI commands to create a LWC (Lightning Web Components) when working with Salesforce projects. This extension creates a ready-to-go component, with the exposed and ready-to-go meta.xml and a CSS file for the component

## Usage 🔎

```
When inside a Salesforce project folder, press CTRL+SHIFT+P (Or ⌘+⇧+P on MAC) and run
>'Create Full LWC'
You will be asked a few options (Pretty straight forward)
```

### This extension can be only used inside Salesforce project folders. Make sure you use it inside your project's main folder (The same where your manifest and sfdx-project.json are)

Please make sure to update your Visual Studio Code and use it only inside a Salesforce Project
